## Ugly Router App

This is literally just a simple React app which routes to different pages.

To use this as a starter template, figure out how to clone down this repo, then run the following commands in the terminal:
* Clone this repo (change "`<repo-name>`" to the desired name of your repository)
```
git clone https://github.com/agentkenny007/Ugly-Router-App.git <repo-name>
```
* Switch to the new directory of the repo
```
cd <repo-name>
```
* Reinitialize git
```
rm -rf .git;git init
```
* Install dependencies and start the app.
```
npm i;npm start
```
